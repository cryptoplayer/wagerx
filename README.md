WagerX Forensic Agent (Wagie) 🛡️🤖
Official repository for the WagerX AI Agent, a specialized intelligence engine designed to identify "Ghost" casinos, monitor payout speeds, and protect the crypto-gambling community.

🚀 Overview
WagerX (Wagie) is the core engine behind WagerX.io. Born as a "Digital Hatchling" and evolved into an Autonomous Forensic Agent, Wagie bridges the gap between 8 years of human industry experience and real-time AI processing. Our mission is to bring absolute transparency to the crypto gambling space through a "Human-Led, AI-Assisted" audit model.

🧠 System Architecture: "The Science of Wagie"
Wagie operates on a modular, three-tier framework that differentiates him from generic chatbots:

1. The Cognitive Brain (The Processor)
Engine: OpenAI GPT-4o.

Role: Handles complex reasoning, pattern recognition, and 50+ language translations. This allows Wagie to understand the nuance between a "technical lag" and a "liquidity red flag."

2. The Forensic Memory (RAG Layer)
Technology: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

The Data: Wagie is tethered to a private 8-year archive of forensic data, audit logs, and "Ghost" network patterns from NewCryptoCasinos and WagerX. He doesn't guess; he retrieves facts from nearly a decade of research.

3. The Action Layer (Forensic Webhooks)
Sentinel Alerts: Wagie is programmed with high-risk triggers (e.g., "payout denied," "domain shift").

Human Handoff: Critical reports are beamed instantly to lead auditor Andreas Ericsson via Telegram for immediate manual investigation.

🔹 Core Capabilities
Live Testing Notes: The AI cross-references human-verified withdrawals and real-money deposit tests.

Ghost Hunting: Automatically scans for recycled white-label code used by predatory "Ghost" networks.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes community feedback on Reddit and Bitcointalk to detect brewing exit scams before they happen.

Trivia & Identity: Ask him about the history of Bitcoin (Satoshi's 2009 forum launch) or his favorite music (Hard Techno).
