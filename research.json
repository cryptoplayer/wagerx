Zero issues found. Our only concern is the new affiliate program—we expect more from Bitsler there.",
  
  "betfury": "AUDIT_LOG: BetFury [VERIFIED SAFE]\n------------------------------------------\nTESTED: 2/2-2026 | DEPOSIT: 2 SOL\nWITHDRAWAL: 7 min | VPN: YES (Norway) | KYC: NO\n\nCOMMUNITY SCORE:\nReddit: 5/5 | Bitcointalk: 5/5\nWAGERX TRUST SCORE: 9.8/10\n\n🛡️ ANDREAS' TAKE: A community staple. Very active on socials (huge green flag). Only catch: Game freshness can lag on brand new Hacksaw/NoLimit drops.",
  
  "rainbet": "AUDIT_LOG: Rainbet [VERIFIED SAFE]\n------------------------------------------\nTESTED: 2/2-2026 | DEPOSIT: 2 SOL\nWITHDRAWAL: 8 min | VPN: YES (Norway) | KYC: NO\n\nCOMMUNITY SCORE:\nReddit: 5/5 | Bitcointalk: 5/5\nWAGERX TRUST SCORE: 9.8/10\n\n🛡️ ANDREAS' TAKE: Tested via Norway VPN. Some lag on Pragmatic slots (VPN related, not casino). Support is excellent—human rep in under 2 minutes.",

Good session, but support response times were slower than competitors. Payouts are reliable but not instant.",
  
  "towerbet": "AUDIT_LOG: Tower Bet [VERIFIED SAFE]\n------------------------------------------\nTESTED: 2/2-2026 | DEPOSIT: 1 ETH\nWITHDRAWAL: 9 min | VPN: YES | KYC: NONE\n\nCOMMUNITY SCORE:\nReddit: 5/5 | Bitcointalk: 4/5\nWAGERX TRUST SCORE: 9.8/10\n\n🛡️ ANDREAS' TAKE: Best option for wagering races. Very popular lately for a reason—the action is consistent and the UI is modern.",
  
  "toshi": "AUDIT_LOG: Toshi Bet [VERIFIED SAFE]\n------------------------------------------\nTESTED: 2/2-2026 | DEPOSIT: 0.003 BTC\nWITHDRAWAL: 5 min | VPN: YES | KYC: NONE\n\nCOMMUNITY SCORE:\nReddit: 5/5 | Bitcointalk: 5/5\nWAGERX TRUST SCORE: 9.8/10\n\n🛡️ ANDREAS' TAKE: Our personal favorite.

A bit over-hyped, but they truly deserve their spot on the 2026 Best Lists for sheer reliability.",
  
  "bcgame": "AUDIT_LOG: BC Game [VERIFIED SAFE]\n------------------------------------------\nTESTED: 1/27-2026 | DEPOSIT: 0.005 BTC\nWITHDRAWAL: 6 min (Post-KYC) | VPN: YES | KYC: YES (at $5.2k)\n\nCOMMUNITY SCORE:\nReddit: 5/5 | Bitcointalk: 5/5\nWAGERX TRUST SCORE: 9.8/10\n\n🛡️ ANDREAS' TAKE: Still one of the best. First time we hit a KYC trigger here, but it was expected due to the $5,200 withdrawal amount.",
